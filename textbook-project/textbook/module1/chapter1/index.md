# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Architecture

Welcome to the first chapter of Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals. This chapter introduces you to the core architectural concepts of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which forms the foundation for most robotic applications in the field of Physical AI.

## Overview

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

In this chapter, you will learn about:
- The fundamental concepts that underpin ROS 2
- How ROS 2 differs from its predecessor, ROS 1
- The key components of the ROS 2 architecture
- Communication patterns in ROS 2

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Understand the purpose and function of different ROS 2 components
- Appreciate the design decisions that led to the ROS 2 architecture
- Begin planning how to structure your own robotic applications using ROS 2

This chapter sets the groundwork for more advanced topics in subsequent chapters and modules, where you'll implement and apply these concepts in practical scenarios.
