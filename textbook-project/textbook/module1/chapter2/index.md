# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Programming

This chapter focuses on practical programming techniques using ROS 2. Building upon the architectural concepts from Chapter 1, you'll learn how to implement ROS 2 nodes, create custom messages, and build complex robotic applications.

## Overview

Programming with ROS 2 requires understanding both the conceptual architecture and the practical implementation details. This chapter covers both Python and C++ approaches to ROS 2 programming, providing you with the tools to implement your robotic systems.

In this chapter, you will learn:
- How to create ROS 2 nodes in Python and C++
- Best practices for ROS 2 programming
- How to design effective message and service interfaces
- Techniques for debugging and testing ROS 2 applications

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create ROS 2 nodes using both Python and C++
- Design and implement custom messages and services
- Apply best practices for ROS 2 software development
- Integrate ROS 2 with other tools and frameworks

This chapter provides the practical foundation for implementing the simulation and AI techniques covered in later modules.
