# Lesson 2.2: ROS 2 Programming with C++

<PersonalizationButton />

## Overview
This lesson covers practical ROS 2 programming techniques using C++, focusing on performance-critical applications in Physical AI systems.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Implement ROS 2 nodes using C++
- Design high-performance robotic applications
- Apply best practices for C++ in robotics

## C++ in ROS 2
C++ is essential for performance-critical components of robotic systems, particularly in Physical AI applications where real-time processing is required.

## Implementation Considerations
C++ provides more control over system resources and performance compared to Python, but requires more careful memory management.

## Ethical and Social Implications
Performance considerations in Physical AI systems directly impact safety and reliability, making C++'s efficiency crucial for responsible system design.

## Summary
C++ programming is essential for high-performance ROS 2 applications in Physical AI systems.

## Self-Assessment
1. When should you use C++ instead of Python in ROS 2 development?
2. What are the challenges of using C++ for robotics applications?

## Next Steps
In the next module, we'll explore simulation environments for testing and developing robotic applications.
