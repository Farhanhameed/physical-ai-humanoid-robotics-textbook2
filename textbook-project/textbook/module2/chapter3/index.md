# Chapter 3: Gazebo Simulation

Simulation plays a crucial role in developing and testing Physical AI systems. This chapter introduces Gazebo, a powerful 3D simulation environment that provides accurate physics simulation, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces.

## Overview

Gazebo is a standalone application that provides a sophisticated physics simulation environment for robotics. It integrates seamlessly with ROS/ROS 2 and allows for realistic robot and environment simulation, which is essential for developing and testing Physical AI systems before deployment on real hardware.

In this chapter, you will learn:
- How to set up and configure Gazebo for robotics simulation
- Techniques for creating realistic robot models
- How to simulate sensors, actuators, and physical interactions
- Integration with ROS 2 for closed-loop control

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Install and configure Gazebo for robotics applications
- Create and simulate robot models with accurate physics
- Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2 for control and perception
- Design simulation scenarios for testing Physical AI systems

Simulation is a critical step in the development of safe and reliable Physical AI systems, allowing for extensive testing in a controlled environment.
