# Lesson 3.1: Gazebo Setup and Robot Modeling

<PersonalizationButton />

## Overview
This lesson covers the fundamentals of setting up the Gazebo simulation environment and creating accurate robot models for Physical AI development and testing.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Install and configure Gazebo for robotics applications
- Create robot models using URDF/SDF
- Validate robot models for simulation

## Gazebo Environment Setup
Gazebo provides a realistic physics simulation environment that is essential for testing Physical AI systems before deployment on real hardware.

## Implementation Considerations
Consider the balance between simulation accuracy and computational performance when designing Gazebo models for Physical AI applications.

## Ethical and Social Implications
Simulation environments allow for safe testing of AI behaviors before deployment, reducing risk to humans and property in real-world testing.

## Summary
Gazebo provides a powerful simulation environment for developing and testing Physical AI systems.

## Self-Assessment
1. What are the key components of a Gazebo robot model?
2. Why is simulation important for Physical AI development?

## Next Steps
In the next lesson, we'll explore physics control and sensor simulation in Gazebo.
